## Hello, I'm Michelle 🐟<br/>

I'm currently a student at UC Santa Barbara's Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program, with interests in water, marine science, and intersections with animal science. Aside from data science, I enjoy baking pastries and hiking around Santa Barbara.

Please feel free to check out [my website](https://mmyiv.github.io/) to learn more about my projects or contact me at mmyiv@bren.ucsb.edu
